# Rainydays â€“ Cross-Course Project

Rainydays is an e-commerce website for a fictional outdoor jacket brand.  
This was created as the Cross-Course Project in the Front-End Development programme at Noroff.

The goal of the project was to build a responsive and accessible online store using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
